# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers Phase 1 of the Overdrive project: Project Setup and Familiarization. Overdrive is a personal fork of the Spacedrive open-source file manager, focused exclusively on Linux desktop and Android platforms. The goal is to simplify the project by maximizing Rust usage for safety and performance while dropping support for other platforms to reduce scope.

Phase 1 establishes the foundation by ensuring the development environment is properly configured, the existing Spacedrive codebase is understood, and the project scope is clearly defined for the Linux/Android-only approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer starting the Overdrive project, I want to successfully build and run the forked Spacedrive code on Linux, so that I have a working baseline to begin modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer clones the Overdrive repository THEN the system SHALL have all required dependencies installed (Rust toolchain, Node.js, etc.)
2. WHEN the developer runs the build command THEN the system SHALL compile successfully without errors
3. WHEN the developer launches the desktop application THEN the system SHALL display the Spacedrive interface on Linux
4. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL generate working binaries for the desktop application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer familiarizing with the codebase, I want to understand Spacedrive's architecture and technology stack, so that I can make informed decisions about what to keep, modify, or remove for Overdrive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer reviews the project documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear understanding of the PRRTT stack (Prisma, Rust, React, TypeScript, Tauri)
2. WHEN the developer examines the core modules THEN the system SHALL reveal how the Rust core (sdcore) interacts with the React/TypeScript frontend
3. WHEN the developer analyzes the RPC communication THEN the system SHALL show how Tauri and rspc facilitate frontend-backend communication
4. WHEN the developer studies the database layer THEN the system SHALL demonstrate how Prisma handles data persistence and queries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer planning the Overdrive scope, I want to identify which components to keep or remove from the Spacedrive monorepo, so that I can focus development efforts on Linux/Android-specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer audits the monorepo structure THEN the system SHALL identify core Rust libraries that must be retained
2. WHEN the developer reviews platform-specific code THEN the system SHALL highlight macOS/Windows/iOS components that can be removed
3. WHEN the developer examines the apps directory THEN the system SHALL distinguish between essential (desktop) and non-essential (landing, storybook) applications
4. WHEN the developer analyzes dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify React Native mobile components that will be replaced with Tauri for Android

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer defining the MVP scope, I want to establish clear goals for what the minimal viable product should accomplish on Linux, so that development efforts remain focused and achievable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer defines MVP features THEN the system SHALL include basic file indexing (file discovery) functionality
2. WHEN the developer specifies core capabilities THEN the system SHALL include a file explorer UI for browsing indexed files
3. WHEN the developer establishes success criteria THEN the system SHALL define measurable goals for file scanning and display performance
4. WHEN the developer documents MVP scope THEN the system SHALL exclude advanced features like cloud sync, AI tagging, and multi-platform support

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the development workflow, I want to configure proper tooling and documentation, so that future development phases can proceed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer sets up the development environment THEN the system SHALL have proper IDE configuration for Rust and TypeScript development
2. WHEN the developer configures build tools THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading for frontend changes and efficient Rust compilation
3. WHEN the developer establishes testing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL support running unit tests for Rust core modules
4. WHEN the developer documents the setup process THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for other contributors to replicate the environment
